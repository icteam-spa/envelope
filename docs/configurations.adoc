= Configuration specification
:toc: left

This page specifies the configurations available in Envelope.

== Example configuration

As illustration, a typical Envelope batch application that reads HDFS JSON files, extracts a subset of data, and writes
the results to S3 in Parquet might have the following configuration.

----
application {
  name = Envelope configuration example
  executors = 3
  executor.memory = 4G
}
steps {
  exampleInput {
    input {
      type = filesystem
      path = "hdfs://..."
      format = json
    }
  }
  exampleStep {
    dependencies = [exampleInput]
    deriver {
      type = sql
      query.literal = "SELECT MY_UPPER(foo) AS foo FROM exampleInput WHERE MY_LOWER(bar) = 'blag'"
    }
    planner {
      type = append
    }
    output {
      type = filesystem
      path = "s3a://..."
      format = parquet
    }
  }
}
udfs : [
  {
    name = my_upper
    class = com...
  },
  {
    name = my_lower
    class = com...
  }
]

|name
|The application name in YARN.

|executors
|The number of executors to be requested for the application. If not specified then Spark dynamic allocation will be used.

|executor.cores
|The number of cores per executor. Default is 1.

|executor.memory

=== Outputs

Output configurations belong to data steps, and have the `steps.[stepname].output.` prefix.

[cols="2,8a", options="header"]
|===
|Configuration suffix|Description

|type
|The output type to be used. Envelope provides `filesystem`, `hive`, `jdbc`, `kafka`, `kudu`, `log`, `hbase`, `zookeeper`. To use a custom output, specify the fully qualified name or alias of the `Output` implementation class.

||
|`_filesystem_`|

|path
|The Hadoop filesystem path to write as the output. Typically a Cloudera EDH will point to HDFS by default. Use `s3a://` for Amazon S3.

|format
|The file format for the files of the output directory. Envelope supports formats `parquet`, `csv` and `json`.

|partition.by
|The list of columns to partition the write output. Optional.

|separator
|(csv) Spark option `sep`; sets the single character as a separator for each field and value. (default ,)

|quote
|(csv) Spark option `quote`; sets the single character used for escaping quoted values where the separator can be part of the value. (default ")

|escape
|(csv) Spark option `escape`; sets the single character used for escaping quotes inside an already quoted value. (default \)

|escape-quotes
|(csv) Spark option `escapeQuotes`; a flag indicating whether values containing quotes should always be enclosed in quotes. Default is to escape all values containing a quote character. (default `true`)

|quote-all
|(csv) Spark option `quoteAll`; a flag indicating whether all values should always be enclosed in quotes. Default is to only escape values containing a quote character. (default `false`)

|header
|(csv) Spark option `header`; writes the names of columns as the first line. (default `false`)

|null-value
|(csv) Spark option `nullValue`; sets the string representation of a null value. (default empty string)

|compression

|date-format
|(csv) Spark option `dateFormat`; sets the string that indicates a date format. Custom date formats follow the formats at `java.text.SimpleDateFormat`. This applies to `date` type. (default `yyyy-MM-dd`)

|timestamp-format
|(csv) Spark option `timestampFormat`; sets the string that indicates a timestamp format. Custom date formats follow the formats at `java.text.SimpleDateFormat`. This applies to `timestamp` type. (default `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZZ`)

||
|`_hive_`|

|table
|The name of the Hive table targeted for write. The name can include the database prefix, e.g. `example.SampleTableName`. If the table does not exist, Envelope will create a Parquet-formatted table. If the table has been created outside of Envelope, the format is determined and managed by Hive itself, i.e. any Hive SerDe.

|location
|Optional. The HDFS location for the underlying files of a table. Typically only defined during table creation, during which the table is created as `EXTERNAL`, otherwise the table is created in the default Hive warehouse and set to `MANAGED`.

|partition.by
|Optional. The list of Hive table partition names to dynamically partition the write by.

|options
|Used to pass additional configuration parameters. The parameters are set as a Map object and passed directly to the Spark DataFrameWriter.

||
|`_jdbc_`|

|url
|The JDBC URL for the remote database.

|tablename
|The name of the table of the remote database to write as the output.

|username
|The username to use to connect to the remote database.

|password
|The password to use to connect to the remote database.

||
|`_kafka_`|

|brokers
|Required. The hosts and ports of the brokers of the Kafka cluster, in the form `host1:port1,host2:port2,...,hostn:portn`.

|topic
|Required. The Kafka topic to write to.

|serializer.type
|Required. The type of serialization to use for writing the row in to the topic. Valid types are `delimited` and `avro`.

|serializer.field.delimiter
|Required if `serializer.type` is `delimited`. The delimiter string to separate the field values with.

|serializer.schema.path
|Required if `serializer.type` is `avro`. The path to the Avro schema file for serializing the rows, e.g. `hdfs:/your/path/to/schema.avsc`.

|parameter.*
|Used to pass configurations directly to the Kafka client. The `parameter.` prefix is removed and the configuration is set in the Kafka parameters map object used to create the KafkaProducer.

||
|`_kudu_`
|Note: For Envelope pipelines with a Kudu output, and with security enabled, and in YARN cluster mode, and where using a random planner (such as history or bitemporal), then you must add `--conf spark.kudu.master.addresses=yourkuduconnectionstringhere` to your `spark2-submit` call.

|connection
|The hosts and ports of the masters of the Kudu cluster, in the form "host1:port1,host2:port2,...,hostn:portn".

||
|`_log_`|

|delimiter
|The delimiter string to separate the field values with. Default is `,`.

|level
|The log4j level for the written logs. Default is `INFO`.

||
|`_hbase_`|

|table.name
|Required. The table for the output, specified in the format `[namespace:]name`, e.g. `envelopetest:test`.

|zookeeper
|Optional. In non-secure setups it is not a strict requirement to supply an hbase-site.xml file on the classpath,
so the ZooKeeper quorum can be specified with this property with the usual HBase configuration syntax. Note that
this will supersede any quorum specified in any hbase-site.xml file on the classpath.

|hbase.conf.*
|Optional. Pass-through options to set on the HBase connection. The `hbase.conf` prefix will be stripped. For example:

....
hbase {
  conf {
    hbase.client.retries.number = 5
    hbase.client.operation.timeout = 30000
  }
}
....

Note that non-String parameters are automatically cast to Strings, but the underlying HBase code will do any
required conversions from String.

|mapping.serde
|Optional. The fully qualified class name of the implementation to use when converting Spark `Row` objects into HBase `Put` s and `Get` s and
converting HBase `Result` s into `Row` s. Defaults to `default`, which is maps to `com.cloudera.labs.envelope.utils.hbase.HBase.DefaultMappingSerde`.
The default serde configuration syntax adheres as closely as possible to that of the
Spark-HBase DataSource at the expense of some additional functionality - this is with a view to
moving to the HBaseRelation at some point in the future.

|mapping.rowkey
|Required for `default` serde. The ordered list columns which comprise the HBase row key. These are expected to be separated by `rowkey.separator` in HBase, e.g. `["symbol", "transacttime"]`.

|mapping.rowkey.separator
|Optional. The separator to use when constructing the row key. This is interpreted as a Unicode string
so for binary separators use the `\uXXXX` syntax. Defaults to "`:`".

|mapping.columns
|Required for `default` serde. A map of column definitions specifying how to map Row fields into HBase columns. Each
column requires three attributes: the column family `cf`, the column qualifier `col` and
the column type `type`. The columns which comprise the row key are denoted with `cf = rowkey`.
Supported types are int, long, boolean, float, double and string. For example:

....
mapping.columns {
  symbol {
    cf = "rowkey"
    col = "symbol"
    type = "string"
  }
  transacttime {
    cf = "rowkey"
    col = "transacttime"
    type = "long"
  }
  clordid {
    cf = "cf1"
    col = "clordid"
    type = "string"
  }
  orderqty {
    cf = "cf1"
    col = "orderqty"
    type = "int"
  }
}
....

|batch.size
|Optional. An integer value with default 1000. The number of mutations to accumulate before making an HBase RPC call. For larger
cell sizes you may want to reduce this number or increase the relevant client buffers.

||
|`_zookeeper_`|

|connection
|The ZooKeeper quorum to connect to, in the format `host1:port1,...`.

|field.names
|The list of field names for the schema of this output.

|field.types
|The list of field types for the schema of this output, in the same order as `field.names`. For details, see the available options defined in <<Data Type Support>>.

|key.field.names
|The list of field names that constitute the unique key of the output. Must be a subset of `field.names`. Must always be provided in the same order across pipeline executions.

|znode.prefix
|The znode path prefix that the data will be stored under. Used to isolate the use of the output from other uses of the output, and from non-Envelope paths in ZooKeeper. Default `/envelope`.

|session.timeout.millis
|The client session timeout in milliseconds. Default `1000`.

|===

=== Repetitions

For more information on repetitions see the link:repetitions.adoc[repetitions guide].

The general configuration parameters for repetitions are:

[cols="2,8a", options="header"]
|===
|Configuration suffix|Description

|type
|Required. The repetition type to be used. Envelope provides `scheduled` and `flagfile`. To use a custom repetition, specify the fully qualified name of the class (or alias) implementing the `Repetition` interface.

|min-repeat-interval
|Optional. To prevent steps being reloaded too frequently, this represents the minimum interval between repetitions. The value is interpreted as a
Typesafe Config duration, e.g. `60s`. `5m`, `1d` or, without suffix, as raw milliseconds, e.g. `3600000`. Defaults to 60s.

||
|`_scheduled_`|

|every
|Required. The interval between repetitions. The value is interpreted as a
Typesafe Config duration, e.g. `60s`. `5m`, `1d` or, without suffix, as raw milliseconds, e.g. `3600000`. No default.

||
|`_flagfile_`|

|file
|Required. The path to the flag file. Accepts a fully qualified URI (recommended). If not qualified with a filesystem scheme,
the default filesystem implementation will be used (usually HDFS).

|trigger
|Optional. The mode of the trigger functionality. Can either be `present` or `modified`. With `present`, as soon as the file
is detected a repetition is triggered and the flag file is deleted. In `modified` mode, the file is checked for presence
or a modification time greater than the last time the step was loaded. The file is not deleted in `modified` mode. Defaults
to `present`.

|poll-interval
|Optional. How often the flag file will be checked. The value is interpreted as a
Typesafe Config duration, e.g. `60s`. `5m`, `1d` or, without suffix, as raw milliseconds, e.g. `3600000`.Defaults to 10s.

|fail-after
|To prevent intermittent failures to contact the filesystem from killing the job, the repetition will only raise an exception
after this many consecutive failures. Defaults to 10.

|===

== User-defined functions

Spark SQL user-defined functions (UDFs) are provided with a list of UDF specifications under `udfs`, where each specification has the following:

[cols="2,8", options="header"]
